Automated propositional logic theorem prover library written in Haskell


How to use
==========

Right now there isn't really a functional executable.
You can run the test suite with:
```
stack test
```

A number of pre-configured theorems are included and should be provable.

This is a very inefficient implementation, meant more for experimenting with the ideas and understanding. Probably not useful to anyone but including here just for history's sake.
